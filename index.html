    <h2 class="center-text">Hello! My name is Kin and I’d love to join the Founders and Coders community in Winter 2019</h2>

            <h4>What do you do?</h3>
            <p>I’ve been in insurance for 8 years, and have worked in various roles from managing claims to underwriting. Although I’m doing well here, I felt my hunger to learn was not being fed, and I was driven to pursue more. In recent months I have spent my free time before and after work, learning to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It wasn’t long before I knew I wanted to change industry from insurance to work in tech. To accelerate my learning, I have now switched to working part-time, allowing me to also do part-time self-study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="wordContent" id="whyCoding">
            <h4>So why coding?</h3>
            <p>Because it’s fun!</p>
            <p>From the offset, I knew that I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of coding. I like the process of taking a requirement, breaking it down and solving it in small bits, to finally achieve the end result. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had an interest in how things work under the surface, taking toys apart and (trying to) put them back together again. I’ve been browsing the web for 20+ years, but have never really dug beneath the surface until now, and I can’t believe I didn’t start earlier.</p>
            <p>Coding reminds me of the countless hours I spent playing with LEGO, taking little building blocks, and creating something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

    <div class="wordContentContainer">
        <div class="wordContent" id="whyFAC">
            <h4>Why do you want to join Founders and Coders?</h3>
            <p>I first heard about Founders and Coders a few weeks ago, from an alumna who was coaching me at a Codebar event. I was fascinated by the business model and continued to learn more on your website. When I saw that applications for the cohort of Winter 2019 were open, I immediately expressed my interest and started working on the course pre-requisites. I’ve since spoken to several other graduates and current cohort, all of whom had nothing but good things to say about FAC.</p>
            <p>For me, one of the main attractions of Founders and Coders as a bootcamp is the emphasis on group work. As someone who is self-taught, I would love to work collaboratively as a team towards a shared vision, do code reviews and pair programming. I’m also very interested in the sustainability and community aspect of Founders and Coders, where each student on the programme becomes an invested member of the wider FAC community and gives back as much as they can. I’m excited to work on community initiatives like Tech for Better, which enable students to ground their work in the real-world, whilst coding for good and spreading a positive impact to those who need it – win win!</p>

        <div class="wordContent" id="whatWant">
            <h4>Where do you see yourself one year from now?</h3>
            <p>My goal is to have launched a career in front-end / software development, doing work that drives positive change through technology, whether for individuals, community, or business. I want to continue attending meetups such as Codebar, but also be able to contribute and give back by being a coach for other students. I think it’s important to be open to new challenges and opportunities; I’ve only just arrived at the start line, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
