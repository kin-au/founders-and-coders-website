# Kin's Founders and Coders application website

### A one-page website (built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript), submitted as part of my application to the highly selective Founders and Coders course, starting in October 2019

Website requirements

Create a one-page website in HTML and CSS (using some vanilla JavaScript if you’d like) and host it on GitHub Pages. Your commit history should tell a story, and your website must be written by you, and:
- Show us with your code who you are
- Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites
- Tell us about why you are applying for the programme
- Contain a link back to the GitHub repo that contains the code for your site
- Contain links to your freeCodeCamp (please make sure that your profile is public) and Codewars pages
- Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)
- Be hosted on Github
- Not use a GitHub theme
- Not use any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity ⁠— we want to see your own code.
